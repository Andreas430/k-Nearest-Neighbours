# k-Nearest-Neighbours
kNN applied to toy problem for visualization



<p align="justify">The algorithm works by finding the nearest points (neighbors) next to our desired point including noise in the prediction. The number of neighbours, k, is a hyperparameter and the predictions are based on it. The algorithm finds the closest neighbors by calculating the distances from a desired point to every single data point and then chooses the specified k nearest points. A commonly used distance is the Euclidean distance. Lastly, knn averages the respective property values to give an answer. </p>
